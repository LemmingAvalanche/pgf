PGF – The Pretty Good Formatter
===============================

This repository contains implementations and examples for PGF:


  pgf-experimental/  – experimental Rascal implementation, with some examples. The interesting stuff is in src/org/nuthatchery/pgf/rascal/engines (a spacer and two line breaking variants). The examples found in our submitted SLE2013 paper can be found by importing org::nuthatchery::pgf::rascal::tests::TestPaper and running testPaper1() and testPaper2()


There is also a somewhat different experimental implementation in Racket. It can be found from a separate repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/bldl/pgf-racket "PGF in Racket").
